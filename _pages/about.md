My mission is to help brilliant researchers unlock their capacity for innovation and impact.

I build and deliver innovative research impact programs, foster and aid researcher-led entrepreneurship, and develop mutually beneficial industry-academia partnerships. Prior to working with researchers to empower impact, I worked as a researcher on advanced energy materials and nanomaterials, and have been involved in over 45 scientific publications.

This is a portfolio website with links to my publications, presentations, and some blog-like posts on outcomes of my work that haven't been published elsewhere.
