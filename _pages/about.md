I guide industry and academia in Australia to work together & take sustainable technologies from the science lab into the real world.

I've been working for over a decade in the areas of advanced energy materials research, research management, and industry-academia collaborations.

This is a portfolio website with links to my publications, presentations, and some blog-like posts on outcomes of my work that haven't been published elsewhere.
