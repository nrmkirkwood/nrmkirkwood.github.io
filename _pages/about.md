I am driven to help build a better, more sustainable future. In my work I enable research to make a difference acroos the spectrum of technology development. This includes:
- Governance for large, blue-sky scientific collaborations to enhance knowledge impact,
- Managing translational tech development to drive end-user impact of research,
- Leveraging research policy & innovation programs to train researchers for the broad range of careers now available to researchers.

I've been working for over a decade in the areas of advanced energy materials research, industry-academia collaborations, technology development, and research management.

This is a portfolio website with links to my publications, presentations, and some blog-like posts on outcomes of my work that haven't been published elsewhere.
