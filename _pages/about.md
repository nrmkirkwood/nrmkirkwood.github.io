I'm a researcher, technology development and industry engagement expert with over a decade of experience in advanced energy materials research, translating scientific discoveries into sustainable technologies, and managing industry-academia collaborations.

I care deeply about meeting our energy needs with zero or at least net-zero emissions. Our present energy production & consumption comes at the expense of future generations and I believe we owe it to them to put every effort into mitgating this. 

Combining this challenge with a passion for technology and science, I pursued a research career developing quantum materials that enable better solar cells or more energy-efficient lighting (amongst other things), and progressed some towards prototypes and proof-of-concept studies.

Driven by a desire to make a more direct impact, I have shifted my focus to techno-economic analysis and market implementation of emerging renewable energy solutions within a large research centre. I've also developed an [energy use reduction retro-fit device for research labs](https://nrmkirkwood.github.io/projects/fumehoodfred/).

More broadly, I am interested in understanding what a truly sustainable circular economy could look like and how we could get there.

My recent work projects include:

- Running an [Entrepreneurship program](https://excitonscience.com/entrepreneurship-funding) that resulted in a spin-out company and over 7x gain on an internal $75k seed investment in the form of a [$539k grant](https://rmsoni.researchgrants.gov.au/RMS/Report/Download/Report/1b0c8b2e-7bb0-4f2d-8f52-ad207cfbb41d/4)

- Creating techno-economic analysis tools for promising early stage research projects to estimate production costs during scale-up, guiding initial customer/market targets

- Managing two R&D collaborations through stage-gates in close collaboration with industry partners: Solar windows with [ClearVue PV](https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2021/06/29/how-nanoparticles-enabled-completely-clear-industry-standard-solar-windows-yes-theyre-finally-here-and-targeting-5-efficiency/) and note security features with the [Reserve Bank of Australia](https://excitonscience.com/themes/novel-security-features-reserve-bank-australia)

- Informing research pivots to maximise downstream commercial potential through [customer & market discovery research](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nicholaskirkwood_avail-solar-receive-csiro-bonus-activity-7092707685506187264-1ePx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

- Building [new industry linkages](https://excitonscience.com/connect-program-partners) to help drive technologies to market

My past research in both Australia and the Netherlands has involved applications of semiconductor nanoparticles a.k.a. 'quantum dots' to solve various problems, including: 

- Efficient [lighting](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.0c00583), [display](https://doi.org/10.1002/admi.201600868), and [solar](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2017.04.034) technologies enabled by [quantum dots that are almost perfect light emitters](https://doi.org/10.1021/cm402645r)

- Building local manufacturing capability of [magnetic nanoparticles](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c01275) in medical diagnostic tests including [COVID-19 PCR testing](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-nanoparticle-ingredient-for-australian-made-covid-tests) and [fluorescent lateral flow assays](https://radetecdiagnostics.com/quantum-dot-technology/)

- A cheap, low-energy method to manufacture solar cells using [metal pnictide nanocrystals](https://doi.org/10.1002/admi.201901600)

Outside of my work, I spend my time with my family, cycling, reading, and camping.
