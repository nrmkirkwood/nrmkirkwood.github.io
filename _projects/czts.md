### Silicon solar panels are amazing...
The eco-credentials of silicon solar panels are well-established. They typically repay their embedded carbon (the total carbon footprint from extraction to disposal) within 2-3 years, meaning that for most of their 25+ year lifespan, they are producing truly clean energy. Indeed silicon as a solar panel material has gained immense traction over the past two decades and now dominates the solar energy landscape.

### ...but we still need renewables innovation
Despite the incredible rise and success of silicon solar panels, new innovations will still be critial to reduce the impact of climate change. The [IEA Net Zero by 2050 report](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050) anticipates that over 45% of the annual CO2 emissions savings by 2050 will need to be delivered by technologies still in development. There are also [large sums of money](https://breakthroughvictoria.com/breakthrough-victoria-challenge/) being offered by governments to anyone who can help solve end-of-life problems for the ever-increasing volume of solar panel waste.

These challenges underscore the pressing need for revolutionary solar technologies that are not only more efficent, affordable and simpler to manufacture but also easier to recycle compared to the current silicon solar panels.

### Our Contribution: Lightweight, non-toxic CZTS solar
Our researchers pioneered a groundbreaking method to fabricate lightweight CZTS solar cells using only low-energy processes. (CZTS stands for 'Copper, Zinc, Tin, Sulfur and Selenium', which are the elements these solar cells are composed of). This approach not only eliminates the use of toxic materials in many other emerging solar technologies (such as lead-rich [perovskites](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13910-y)) but also reduces embedded carbon when compared to traditional silicon solar panels, and in the long run, should be more cost-effective to manufacture.

In 2023 I led an initiative as part of CSIRO's 'On Prime' program to critically evaluate our assumption that these innovative CZTS solar cells could not only compete with existing silicon cells, but also be manufactured in Australia.

### What we discovered
Our journey involved interviewing a diverse group, from the world's leading silicon PV manufacturer in China to local architects, PV installers, and grid-scale solar farm managers. The goal of these interviews was to get a comprehensive understanding of the significant technical problems across the photovoltaics value chain and discern if solution-processed copper zinc tin sulfide selenium solar cells might be the answer.

Our research shed light on a few critical points:

 - Lightweight, flexible, and economically produced PV may find it challenging to replace silicon directly in existing installations. We heard from multiple sources that the extensive investment in silicon-specific materials, processes, and skills at every stage of the conventional PV value chain would be a huge barrier to allowing a disruptive new technology to enter the market. The industry's risk-averse attitude, mainly due to the necessity for product lifespans exceeding 20 years, is another stumbling block.

- However, CZTS could find its niche in areas where the panel's aesthetics, flexibility, or weight overshadow efficiency concerns. Prime examples include warehouse rooftops, which often can't bear the weight of heavy silicon panels, vehicle-integrated solar solutions, and IoT devices with embedded solar panels.

- Notably, we learned from solar manufacturers and customers that there's a growing interest in enhancing the efficiencies of silicon PV through a tandem structure. This approach involves adding a solution-processed cell on top of a conventional silicon cell, increasing power output without the need for additional space. While there's [excitement around silicon/perovskite tandems](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/06/revolutionary-solar-power-cell-innovations-break-key-energy-threshold) due to their impressive results, CZTS cells, we believe, will provide longer product lifetimes and alleviate the toxicity concerns inherent with perovskites.
