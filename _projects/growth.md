### Are there limits to growth?
Meeting our energy needs without any harmful GHG emissions, reducing our material consumption and eliminating or utilising our waste outputs. It is clear our economic system has overstepped the sustianable limit for these three things, and we owe it to future generations to find a way back to a long-term sustainable economy. 

From what I can see the zero-emissions energy aspect is an achievable goal, although how quickly we get there is an open question. The other two seem more challenging, and (from what I'm seeing at least) the focus of less political attention.

Letâ€™s assume we get to a net-zero or even zero emissions energy system. Everything I read tells me exponential economic growth is required in order to have a healthy economy. But in 1972 [The Limits to Growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth) report pointed out the obvious: Exponential growth of an economy that consumes more resources as it grows is unsustianable on a world of finite resources. 

If that means an ever-increasing demand for energy, we will ultimately run out of resources to build all the solar panels, wind farms and batteries. But what about ther materials we use for everything else - clothes, cars, houses, computers, roads and so on? Will these increase too as our economy grows ever larger? The environmental and social issues from mining raw materials, and waste generated from end-of-life products, would ultimately become too great to continue.

This blog post will naively set out to investigate these questions. I'm aware other people study this for a living. I'm just trying to get a good idea in my own head what the answers might be, and hopefully that's useful.

Firstly, where are we now with energy and material use?

### Australia's Energy Consumption
In 2020, Australia's total local energy consumption was 1.7 TWh (6,014 PJ). On average, an Australian uses about 180 kWh/day, which is 60 times more than a human's basic daily energy needs. If we include our exports (which we should!) then it's a lot higher - 200 times a human's basic daily needs! Comparatively, the EU's consumption is about 38 times a human's basic needs. 

Notably, renewables now account for around 23% of electricity generated for our grid in Australia, and this figure is steadily rising. But this is just a portion of all of our energy use and we export a lot of fossil fuels. 

Global Energy Consumption Trends
The global change in energy consumption has been significant. Various sources, such as ourworldindata.org, provide insights into these shifts.

### Our Material Consumption
Understanding the consumption of Earth's materials is equally crucial. The Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) and Material Footprint (MF) metrics provide insights into the materials directly used within a national economy and those required across global supply chains, respectively.

### What's the relationship to economic growth?
There's a growing momentum towards a "net-zero" emissions future. However, the relationship between economic growth and environmental impacts remains a topic of debate.

### Three Futures
Keep Growing: This approach believes that human ingenuity will eventually overcome potential limitations to economic growth.

Decoupled Growth: Also known as "green growth" or "sustainable growth," this approach promotes economic growth while reducing the use of natural resources and GHG emissions.

Post-growth Economy: Also known as "degrowth" or "prosperous descent," this approach focuses on improving social wellbeing rather than GDP growth.

### Challenges with Decoupled Growth
While decoupled growth seems promising, there are several challenges:

Rising energy expenditure to extract resources.
Rebound effects, such as increased driving due to the lower cost per km of EVs.
Problem shifting, like the issue of solar waste from PV.
The service economy still requires a material economy.
Recycling remains difficult and limited.
Technology is not advancing fast enough to address some areas, such as environmental degradation.
Post-growth Economy (Degrowth)
The concept of "degrowth" focuses on "circularity" and "sufficiency." This approach suggests that GDP may be becoming an increasingly irrelevant measure of welfare. Instead, the focus should be on improving social wellbeing and planetary health.

### Conclusion
The path to a sustainable future is complex and multifaceted. While there are challenges in each approach, understanding the effects of our energy use is the first step towards making informed decisions for a better tomorrow.
