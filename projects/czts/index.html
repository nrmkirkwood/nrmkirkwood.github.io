Silicon solar panels typically repay their embedded carbon (the total carbon footprint from extraction to disposal) within 2-3 years, meaning that for most of their 25+ year lifespan, they are producing truly clean energy. Along with dramatic cost increases, this has allowed silicon PV to gain immense traction as a renewable energy source over the past two decades. Silicon now <a href="https://solarmagazine.com/solar-panels/thin-film-solar-panels/#:~:text=This%20technology%20currently%20represents%205.1,Film%20Panels" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dominates</a> the PV landscape with well over 90% of the market share. Notable non-silicon technologies are cadmium telluride (5% market share), CIGS (2% market share) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) based cells used in space (not mass-produced as they are very expensive).</p> <h3 id="but-we-still-need-innovation">But we still need innovation</h3> <p>Despite the incredible rise and success of silicon PV, new innovations will still be critial to reduce the impact of climate change. The <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IEA Net Zero by 2050 report</a> anticipates that over 45% of the annual CO2 emissions savings by 2050 will need to be delivered by technologies still in development.</p> <p>One notable issue is that recycling or re-use of silicon PV is not currently economically viable. There are <a href="https://breakthroughvictoria.com/breakthrough-victoria-challenge/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">large sums of money</a> being offered by governments to anyone who can help solve the challenge posed by the rapidly increasing volume of PV waste we generate. It should be noted that PV waste is currently and will continue to be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-023-02230-0" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dwarfed by other forms of waste</a>, but that doesn’t mean it’s not important to minimise it.</p> <p>Another potential issue is that the vast majority of the silicon PV supply chain is <a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/research/natural-environment/Critical-minerals/Australian-Silicon-Action-Plan" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">concentrated in a single country</a>. This could be seen through a geopolitical lens as a future energy security risk, and complicates creating a circular economy.</p> <p>Finally, the rise in efficiency of silicon solar panels has <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">stagnated</a> in the past decade, and is so close to the theoretical limit (for silicon) that it will probably not increase signficantly from now. New PV technologies which can improve the efficiency of silicon without increasing the cost of energy produced would be highly desirable.</p> <p>These challenges underscore the pressing need for revolutionary solar technologies that are not only more efficent, affordable and simpler to manufacture but also easier to recycle compared to the current silicon solar panels.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/czts-silicon-value-chain-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/czts-silicon-value-chain-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/czts-silicon-value-chain-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/czts-silicon-value-chain.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="silicon value chain" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Concentration and dominance of silicon PV value chain by a single country (source for numbers: PwV and CSIRO 'Australian Silicon Action Plan', link in text). </div> <h3 id="lightweight-non-toxic-czts-solar">Lightweight, non-toxic CZTS solar</h3> <p>Researchers in the centre I work at are pioneering a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202211421" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new method</a> to fabricate lightweight CZTS solar cells using only low-energy processes. (CZTS stands for ‘Copper, Zinc, Tin, Sulfur and Selenium’, which are the elements these solar cells are composed of).</p> <p>This approach not only eliminates the use of toxic materials in many other emerging solar technologies (such as lead-rich <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13910-y" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">perovskites</a>) but also reduces embedded carbon when compared to traditional silicon solar panels, and in the long run, should be more cost-effective to manufacture and have even lower embedded carbon than silicon PV panels. The simpler manufacturing process allow for lower capital costs for a given production scale, which might afford local Australian manufacturing of CZTS PV that would provide both energy securty and local clean energy jobs.</p> <p>PV modules made using CZTS are expected to be much lighter than conventional silicon PV, and potentially flexible as well, which could unlock PV uses in areas where silicon PV currently cannot work due to weight or flexibility constraints.</p> <p>In 2023 I led a team tasked with critically evaluating and testing these purported benefits of CZTS PV to decide if, and how, CZTS solar cells could be brought onto the market and compete with existing silicon PV.

The goal of these interviews was to get a comprehensive understanding of the significant technical problems across the photovoltaics value chain and discern if solution-processed copper zinc tin sulfide selenium solar cells might be the answer.</p> <p>Our research shed light on a few critical points:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Lightweight, flexible, and economically produced PV sounds great, but it will be challenging to compete with silicon directly in conventional rooftop or grid-scale solar farm installations.</strong> We heard from multiple sources that the extensive investment in silicon-specific materials, processes, and skills at every stage of the conventional PV value chain would be a huge barrier to allowing a disruptive new technology to enter the market. The industry’s risk-averse attitude, mainly due to the necessity for product lifespans exceeding 20 years, is another stumbling block.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>CZTS could find its niche in areas where the panel’s aesthetics, flexibility, or weight overshadow efficiency concerns.</strong> Prime examples include building-integrated photovoltaics, warehouse rooftops (which often can’t bear the weight of heavy silicon panels), vehicle-integrated solar solutions, and IoT devices with embedded solar panels.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Assessing the recyclablability or end-of-life implications of a solar panel is not trivial.</strong> It often depends on how easily the various layers can be separated from each other which requires a lot of research and testing. Researchers and funders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sustainability-considerations-organic-electronic-products-watkins/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">should consider this</a> when deciding whether to scale up and commercialise a technology.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>We met skepticism that Australian manufacturing of any PV product could be done at a scale that was competetive with silicon PV produced in China.</strong> If a new PV product was to be made in Australia, either an unfeasibly large initial investment would be required (on the order of $billions). However, if an initial niche market where CZTS holds a competetive edge can be identified, there might be some hope, especially if coupled to a means to rapidly expand via existing infrastructure for manufacturing (rather than building each plant from scratch).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Solar manufacturers and solar farm operators have an interest in enhancing the efficiencies of silicon PV through a tandem structure.</strong> This approach involves adding a solution-processed cell on top of a conventional silicon cell, increasing power output without the need for additional space. While there’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/06/revolutionary-solar-power-cell-innovations-break-key-energy-threshold" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">excitement around silicon/perovskite tandems</a> due to their impressive results, CZTS cells, we believe, will provide longer product lifetimes and alleviate the toxicity concerns inherent with perovskites.</p> </li> </ul> <p>We concluded that a silicon/CZTS tandem PV product is the most likely means to get CZTS technology onto the market. This approach will require extensive collaboration with silicon PV manufactuerers.</p> <p>You can read the article on our findings, which received a $4,000 bonus to go towards our research, <a href="https://excitonscience.com/news/avail-solar-receive-csiro-bonus" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Nicholas Kirkwood.
