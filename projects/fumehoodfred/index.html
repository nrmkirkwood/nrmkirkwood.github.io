The International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that, even with widespread renewables uptake, we need to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">triple the current rate of energy efficiency improvements in buildings over the next ten years</a>.</p> <h3 id="application-to-research-labs">Application to research labs</h3> <p>Research labs should not be exempt from this.

Bottom: Chemistry Building daily energy consumption over 1 year. Source: University of Melbourne Utility Report Database via Clariti (https://sustainablecampus.unimelb.edu.au/energy/on-campus) </div> <p>Over a single week, binning the data into hourly blocks, there was a fairly constant baseline of around 1,100 kWh energy consumption per hour. During working hours, consumption peaks between 1,500-1,900 kWh per hour. To contextualise these numbers, the fridge/freezer in a residential house might use 0.25 kWh per hour.</p> <p>Let’s average that out some more. Over the past year, binning the data into daily blocks, energy consumption was around 27-28 MWh per day on the weekend and around 30-40 MWh per day Mon-Fri. Adding up over a year, from September 2022-September 2023 our building consumed 11,575 MWh of energy. (I have no idea why the energy use is so different in Jan-March 2023 than the rest of the year - maybe some change in how the energy use was metered?).</p> <p>These numbers are hard to understand without a comparison to other industries or residential energy use. To do this, I’ll take average/typical numbers for energy use (per year) for each sector and divide by area of floor space. This might seem a little arbitrary - why not divide by number of people working in each building - but it’s how the data is presented in the <a href="https://www.energy.gov.au/publications/commercial-buildings-energy-consumption-baseline-study-2022" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DCCEW “Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Baseline Study 2022”</a> which makes it a convenient way to compare energy consumption. For residential, I took the average home energy use in Victoria from the <a href="https://www.aer.gov.au/system/files/Residential%20energy%20consumption%20benchmarks%20-%209%20December%202020_0.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AER Residential Energy consumption benchmarks (Table 9, averaged across all DNSPs)</a> and the average floor area of a new house in Victoria in 2020-2021 from the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/average-floor-area-new-residential-dwellings" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ABS</a>.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-building-energy-use-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-building-energy-use-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-building-energy-use-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fhf-building-energy-use.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Energy use of buildings in different sectors" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Comparison of yearly UoM chemistry building energy consumption (per unit floor area) to buildings in other sectors.

This isn’t surprising, as research buildings have lots of equipment (lasers, spectrometers, liquid nitrogen tanks, air extraction/flow fans, etc) and we have hundreds of students (undergraduate and graduate) doing research or coursework experiments during the day.</p> <h3 id="identifying-obvious-targets-for-energy-reduction">Identifying obvious targets for energy reduction</h3> <p>With this in mind, I set about to see if we could make research labs in our building more efficient without having to rebuild them or buy any expensive new equipment.</p> <p>Turning off lights and equipment after being used is already pretty common practice, so that didn’t seem like a useful avenue to explore. Our lab has some very power-hungry lasers and heating equipment, but in both cases, these are on turned on when needed, and necessary for research.</p> <p>But then I came across a “Chemistry World” article, “How to run a sustainable chemistry lab” (December 2021), in which fume hoods identified as a major culprit of energy waste in labs.

Researchers working with hazardous chemicals will keep their experiment in the fume hood, and powerful fans at the top of the fume hoods extract dangerous chemical vapours.</p> <p>When the fume hood sash is closed, the fans in each fume hood draw little air, and energy use is low. But when open, fume hood fans can consume around 2-3 kWh per hour, about the same as 3 residential houses. This is a necessary evil when the researcher is doing their experiments in the fume hood (typically a few hours a day for a chemist).</p> <p>But above all else, I already knew from our lab that researchers leave the fume hoods open a lot. No amount of asking nicely seems to change this and university research labs have no real organisational structures to enforce behavioural changes. To make matters worse, our building probably contains 50-100 or so fume hoods, most of them without any features to automatically close or turn off if they are left open.</p> <p>This was the ‘easily avoidable’ energy consumption I was looking for – we just need to figure out how to get research students to close their fume hoods when not in use!</p> <p>Others have made elaborate stickers that warn users of the horrible energy consumption of a fume hood left open. I tried this in our lab but it seemed mostly useless. The fume hoods were still left up.</p> <h3 id="my-solution-fred-fumehood-reduction-in-energy-device">My solution: FRED (Fumehood Reduction in Energy Device)</h3> <p>At this point I’d been learning Python and playing around with Raspberry Pi microcontrollers for fun, so I decided to build a retrofit device which would detect fumehoods being left open and somehow encourage people to close them.</p> <p>The result was FRED (Fumehood Reduction in Energy Device). FRED is a cheap fumehood retrofit using a Raspberry Pi Pico (under AUD$10 at the time of writing) and a few off-the-shelf electronic items (two buzzers and a magnetic switch). The whole thing costs just $20-25 per fumehood. I also designed a little 3D printable case that helps to enclose it all and line up the sensors.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-final-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-final-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-final-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fhf-final.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Latest FRED" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fhf.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="FRED smiling with its lid on" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-proto-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-proto-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-proto-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fhf-proto.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="prototyping FRED" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-teamspost-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-teamspost-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-teamspost-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fhf-teamspost.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Example of a post to MS Teams" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Top left: The latest iteration of FRED including 3D printed case (lid off).

(As a side note, it quickly became clear the annoying buzzing sound was more effective than the MS Teams posting at changing behaviour, but it’s fun to do both.)</p> <h3 id="meausing-freds-impact">Meausing FRED’s impact</h3> <p>Anecdotally, the fume hoods spend a lot more time closed now. The Raspberry Pi at the heart of FRED is easily capable of data logging so I ran a long-term experiment to see if FRED had a meaningful effect. I left FRED with the buzzing noises (and Teams posts) off in a fume hood for 1 month to log baseline data, then turned on FRED’s buzzers and posting and recorded for another month the effect on how often and how long the fumehood was left open. The data shows a clear reduction in time left open, driven by significantly fewer episodes where a fume hood is left open for over an hour. Using the <a href="https://fumehoodcalculator.lbl.gov/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LBL fumehood energy use calculator available online</a> with inputs based on our fume hoods, I converted time left open into an estimated energy consumption.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-cumulative-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-cumulative-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-cumulative-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fhf-cumulative.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="cumulative time open comparison" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-results-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-results-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/fhf-results-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fhf-results.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="results of FRED trial" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Left: Cumulative time fumehood left open for control (alerts off) and with FRED buzzer on (alerts on) during two measurement time periods of the same length.

The data is estimated by comparing data logs taken during a control month with FRED installed in a fume hood and logging data with 'alerts off' (no buzzer or posts) and a month in the same fume hood with the alerts on (buzzer and Teams posting activated). </div> <p>This is a back-of-the-envelope way to calculate energy use, but the result was clear: A <em>significant</em> reduction in energy consumption of around 33% or around 3 MWh per year per fume hood. When installed in all four fumehoods in our lab, this equates to about 13 tCO2e avoided (using the <a href="https://www.esc.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/greenhouse-gas-co-efficient-2021_0.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DELWP GHG coefficient of 1.09 tCO2e/MWh from 2021</a>), roughly equivalent to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">removing 3 cars from the road</a>. FRED also saves whoever pays the bills for our lab around $2,500 per year, assuming an energy price of <a href="https://www.canstarblue.com.au/electricity/electricity-costs-kwh/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$0.21/kWh</a>.</p> <h3 id="impact-for-the-entire-building">Impact for the entire building</h3> <p>The data above is just for one lab – we estimated there are around 100 fume hoods in the Chemistry department alone. That means we could reduce the total energy consumption of our department by around 300 MWh per year, around 2-3% of the current 11,500 MWh yearly consumption figure, and over 300 tCO2e avoided (they yearly equivalent of approximately 70 cars). That’s pretty decent for a retrofit that costs $25 and only takes a few minutes to install.</p> <h3 id="due-diligence">Due-diligence</h3> <p>As a final bit of due-diligence: surely there’s existing ways to solve this obviously quite significant energy use problem? The answer is yes, but at a significant cost. I asked our lab system provider to quote a retrofit or refit of our furmehoods to incorporate an energy saving feature that closes the sash (or at least alarms when left open) and we got a quote of just over $4,000 per fume hood (excl GST) which is about 150-200 times more expensive than FRED.</p> <p>As a final note, I’ve recently noticed an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8560830/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">incredible similar device being described by a team at MIT in a peer-reviewed publication</a> and an assosciated <a href="https://thelichenlab.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">start-up company</a>. Their device even has a fun name (MASH). They arrive at encouragingly similar results to those obtained by FRED, with a more sophisticated and longer-term analysis involving many more fume hoods.</p> <p>The fact that somebody else had the same idea and executed it at the same time, wrote a paper on it, and started a company to commercialise it, proves the idea was good and the similarity of our results is a great outcome.</p> <h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3> <p>The FRED project was greatly assisted by the discussions, advice and superior soldering skills of Jack Heywood-Day and Trent Ralph.
